# Pagal - An experimental player
Pagal is a minimalistic experimental video player. It's written in Node, and wrapped in
Nw.js as a runtime container for easy cross-platform integration.

It utilizes a Customized Player ([WebChimera.js](https://github.com/RSATom/WebChimera.js)) for rendering video via VLC library so basically it can play all video files that VLC can.

Current Features
==============
- Supports Internal Video Subtitles and Audio Tracks

- Supports Almost all kind of video files

- Always on Top Feature

- Supports both VLC's and own Playlist

- An Incredible Hotkeys

Development
===========
I am still learning about how to form a modern node.js application. As a result, the project structure might change from time to time.

While new features are added, some existing features might break too.

If anything doesn't work properly, feel free to open issues and provide enough information so that things can be quickly fixed.

PRs and issues are always appreciated.
