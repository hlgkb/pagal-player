Development
===========
I am still learning about how to form a modern node.js application. As a result, the project structure might change from time to time.
While new features are added, some existing features might break too.
If anything doesn't work properly, feel free to open issues and provide enough information so that things can be quickly fixed.
PRs and issues are always appreciated.
